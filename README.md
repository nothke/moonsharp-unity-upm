A copy of MoonSharp for Unity that works with Unity package manager.

### About

From [MoonSharp.org](https://www.moonsharp.org/):
* MoonSharp is a Lua interpreter written entirely in C# for maximum compatibility in .NET, Mono, Xamarin and Unity.
* It’s a “clean room” design - that is, almost none of the original source code has been reused (apart from parts of the standard library) and most of it has been developed by studying the specifications and the behavior of the official implementations.
